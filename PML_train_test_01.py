# Train / Test
#
# Evaluate Your Model
# -------------------
# In Machine Learning we create models to predict the outcome of certain events, like in the previous chapter where we predicted the CO2 emission of a car when we knew the weight and engine size.
# To measure if the model is good enough, we can use a methos called Train/Test.
#
# What is Train/Test
# ------------------
# Train/Test is a method to measure the accuracy of a model.
# 
# It is called Train/Test because you split the data set into two sets: a training set and a testing set.
# 80% for training, and 20% for testing.
# You train the model using the training set.
# You test the model using the testing set.
# To train the model means to create the model.
# To test the model means to test the accuracy of the model.
#
# Start With a Data Set
# ---------------------
# Start with a data set you want to test.
# Our data set illustrates 100 customers in a shop, and their shopping habits.
#
# Example:

import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
numpy.random.seed(2)

x = numpy.random.normal(3, 1, 100)
y = numpy.random.normal(150, 40, 100) / x

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

# Result:
#
# The x axis represents the number of minutes before making a purchase.
# The y axis represents the amount of money spent on the purchase.
